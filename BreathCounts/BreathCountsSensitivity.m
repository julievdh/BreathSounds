% breathcounts sensitivity test 
% for a deployment

% caculate mean ventilation rate 

% do 100 times
% knock out x breaths randomly 

% calculate mean 

% plot mean ventilation rate versus x breaths knocked out 


% separately:
% for a deployment
% calculate mean ventilation rate over full deployment 

% and over shorter sections

% over what time course does it stabilize?
